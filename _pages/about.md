I am a PhD student at	[Institute of Mathematics](http://www.math.ac.cn/), AMSS, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where my advisor is [Baohua Fu](http://www.math.ac.cn/people/fbh/). I am also a visiting PhD student at [Toulouse Mathematics Institute](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/fr/) from 2023 to 2025, where my advisor is [Laurent Manivel](https://manivel.perso.math.cnrs.fr/).

My current research focues on the geometry of (quasi-)homogenous varieties. 

Papers:
1. A characterization of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type by C^{*}-actions. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04472) submitted.
2. Additive actions on hyperquadrics of corank two. [Journal](https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/era.2022001?viewType=HTML) Electronic Research Archive, 2022, 30(1): 1-34.
